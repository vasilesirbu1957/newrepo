this is a threejs example from https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-load-gltf.html 
It loads six images:
https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/resources/images/flower-1.jpg ... /flower-6.jpg 
and loads a 3D gltf city model. 
This model can be rotated and zoomed in/out.

to run this example:

copy files 'city.html' and 'city.js' in a local directory on your computer;
start a local http server in this local directory, for instance, http-server -c -1 
this server will provide you with an IP and a Port, for example http://127.0.0.1:8081
in 'city.html' make sure to specify this server's IP and port in the url for 'city.js': http://127.0.0.1:8081/city.js
type http://127.0.0.1:8081/city.html in the browser and press 'enter'
